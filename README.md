# VBA Challenge 3

## Overview of Project

Seth and his manager Tom wanted to conduct an analysis of the election results. The purpose of this audit is to import data from a CSV file and export the results to a text file. This process was quickly automated by using python and its easy-to-use functions. 

- Deliverable 1: Total number of votes

- Deliverable 2: A complete list of candidates who received votes

- Deliverable 3: Total number of votes each candidate received

- Deliverable 4: Percentage of votes each candidate won

- Deliverable 5: The winner of the election based on popular vote

## Election-Audit Results

- The amount of votes cast in this congressional election was 369,711 as observed in the text file. 

- Denver County came in with the largest county turnout with 306,055 voters (82.8%). Denver was followed by Jeffrey County with 38,855 voters (10.5%) and Arapahoe County with 24,801 voters (6.7%).

- The county that had the largest number of votes was Denver County. With voters amounting to 306,055 and a percentage of 82.8%.

- Diana DeGette came out as the clear winner of this election with a total of 272,892 votes (73.8%). She was followed by Charles Stockham with 85,213 votes (23.0%) and Raymon Doane with 11,606 votes (3.1%). 

- The candidate that won this election was Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes and a winning percentage of 73.8%. 


## Summary 

For the purposes of the election commission, this python code can retooled for any given set of elections with simple modifications. The most important would be simply adjusting the file path for the code to access the information from a CSV file and this can be done by tracking down the file path and putting in the same destination as the python script and into the script itself. The second control parameter to modify this code for another set of election data would to be change the initial values or the number of empty arrays to capture information if desired then the following for loops can copied and restructured for the desired information.
